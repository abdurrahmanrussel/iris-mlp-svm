# üå∏ Iris Dataset Classification (MLP & SVM)

## üìå Overview
This project implements two machine learning models on the **Iris dataset**:  

1. **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** with two hidden layers.  
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with linear kernel.  

Both models are trained, evaluated, and visualized using accuracy, confusion matrices, classification reports, and ROC curves.

## üöÄ Features
- Data preprocessing (scaling & one-hot encoding for ROC curves)  
- **MLP Classifier**: training with two hidden layers  
- **SVM Classifier**: linear kernel with probability estimates  
- Evaluation:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix (heatmap)
  - Classification Report
  - ROC Curve (per class)
  - Training Loss Curve (MLP only)

## üìä Results
- High accuracy (>90%) for both models  
- Clear confusion matrix and ROC curves for analysis  
- Smooth training loss convergence for MLP
